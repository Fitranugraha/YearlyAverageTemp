# YearlyAverageTemp
Jupyter (python) notebook which pulls weather data using DarkSky API and compares monthly averages across years

Feel free to grab your own API key and try yourself, it should be easy to experiment and grab all sorts of weather data from the API.

This example highlights the difference in average temperature each month between the years 1970 and 2018.
